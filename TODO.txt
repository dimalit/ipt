C++ linting:
 - check that #included all and only used things
 - test coverage
 - naming convention
 - copy ctror dtor move ctor operators etc
 - override
 - find duplication like in polar2vec() and check_ddf.cpp!
 - local variable in loop should be re-initialized every time!

algorithm improvements:
 - sample union distributins not randomly, but round-robin?
