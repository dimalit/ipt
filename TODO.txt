C++ linting:
 - check that #included all and only used things
 - test coverage
 - naming convention
 - copy ctror dtor move ctor operators etc
 - override
 - find duplication like in polar2vec() and check_ddf.cpp!
 - local variable in loop should be re-initialized every time!
 - virtual destructor where it's needed!

algorithm improvements:
 - sample union distributins not randomly, but round-robin?
 - superposition of light and SDF in similar way to LightToDistrubution::value()?
 - how to interchange sampling and scanning? (on SDF, on light hz)

other:
 - remove dynamic_cast's to Ddf
 - find tool to optimize mathematical formulas (sin, sqrt etc)
 - some tool to visualize cmake targets/dependencies

queue:
 - decide with full_theoretical_weights and try-Sample
